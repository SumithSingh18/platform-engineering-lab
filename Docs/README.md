# Platform-engineering-lab

GitOps Driven Kubernetes Platform

*This repository demonstrates how a small organisation can operator Kubernetes using GitOps as a single source of truth*

The focus of this project is platform engineering fundamentals:

<ul>
  <li>Clear ownership of boundaries</li>
  <li>Git-Based control of cluster state</li>
  <li>Minimal friction for application teams</li>
</ul>


Note:
*This platform is cloud-agnostic. I intentionally built it locally to focus on platform design, cost awareness, and reproducibility. The same patterns apply directly to EKS/GKE.*

*This is not a production platform or a SaaS product.*
*It is a hands-on lab designed to model real-world platform practices in a controlled environment.*
